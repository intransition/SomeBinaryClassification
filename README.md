CONTENTS

A few pipeline examples for binary classification
(from data inception to model save)

1. Binary_Classif_v1.3.ipynb
Protocol to train several models using Scikit-Learn algorithms together These can be run for a selectable number of times.
Described and commented throughout, appendices include a to do list.
Stable and functioning


2. BiC_PyCaret_V1.1.ipynb
Protocol to train several models using the pyCaret library â€“ with a few more algorithms (including xgbost and catboost with respec to the nr.1.
Modified/extended version with respect to theone provided by the pycaret docs. 
Described and commented throughout, appendices include a to do list.
Functioning, but a few issues possibly related to library versions remain.
